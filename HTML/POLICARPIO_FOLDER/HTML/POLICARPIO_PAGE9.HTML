		Have Fun By Yourself</h3>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		It's always a good idea to set aside a few days for yourself to do something 
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		enjoyable. You will come to love your own business and will most definitely
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		 feel more secure doing it on your own if you do it this way. This could include 
		<br> 
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		going to the movies, having a date with yourself, or trying new stuff.

		Travel Once A Year</h3>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		It's possible that this is totally out of your comfort zone, but that's a good thing!
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		 This will be a fantastic self-love experience if you are capable of traveling alone.		
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		 You will discover new stuff about yourself as well as about another culture. This 
		<br> 
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		often aids in breaking up the daily routine.

		Forgive Yourself For Your Mistakes </h3>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		Reflecting on your errors will assist you in forgiving and forgetting them. You will 
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		begin to move on and forget about the past if you can forgive yourself for any bad 
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		decisions you might have made. It is beneficial to your self-worth to love yourself
		<br> 
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

		Experiment with things you wouldn't usually do, and say yes to things you wouldn't 
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		normally say yes to. This will also assist you in becoming more acquainted with 
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		yourself. You might discover that you like things you've never known or tried before.
		<br> 
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		 Experiment with stepping outside of your comfort zone and see what happens (it 
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		will almost certainly be positive!).

		You will go back and see how you dealt with those circumstances if you can write 
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		down your thoughts and feelings. This is also a constructive way for you to let go 
		<br>

		<br> 
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

		Give Yourself A Break</h3>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		It's easy for us to be harsh on ourselves at times, but you need to give yourself 
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		a break now and then. No one is flawless, and you shouldn't expect to be either. 
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		Certain circumstances occur, and you must embrace them and refrain from being 
		<br> 
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		too harsh on yourself.

		We also do too much for other people because we want to satisfy them, so we

		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		spread ourselves too thin and take on too much. We may forget to look after 
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		Making a list of your accomplishments is an excellent way to fall in love with 
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		yourself. This makes you feel good about yourself and gives you a sense of 
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		accomplishment. Since it's easy to get caught up in the negativity and forget 
		<br> 
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		about the positives, this is a perfect way to remind yourself of your 
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		accomplishments.
