		<p class="para2"> The ability of ourselves to invoke specific self-schemas while ignoring others, our self-concepts are malleable. 
		At any given time, our self-concept is influenced by the social situations in which we find ourselves belongs, and the feedback,
		we receive from our surroundings is very important to how we perceive ourselves. In some cases, this malleability means that
		certain aspects of the self will be more visible than others. A 14-year-old, for example, may become aware of her youth when 
		she is with a group of elderly people. If the same 14-year-old was in a group of other teenagers, she would be much less likely
		to consider her age because it is somehow normal for them.

		 <b>Baumeister</b> provides the following self-concept definition:
			<b>
			"The individual's belief about himself or herself, including the person's attributes and who and what the self is". </b>
		
	     <h2>The Existential Self</h2>
		 <p class="para2">
			This is the most basic part of the self-scheme or self-concept; the sense of being separate and distinct 
			from others and the awareness of the constancy of the self' (Bee, 1992).
			The child discovers that they are distinct from others and that their life transcends time and space.
			According to Lewis, knowledge of the existential self starts as early as two to three months of age 
			and is influenced in part by the child's relationship with the environment. For example, a child may smile 
			and receive a reciprocal smile, or a child may touch a smartphone and see it move.
			
		<br><br>
		 
		</p>
			
		 <h2>The Categorical Self</h2>
		 <p class="para2">
			After realizing that he or she is a separate experiencing entity, the child
			then realized that he or she is also an object in this world. The child is becoming aware
			of himself or herself as an entity who has an individuality that can be observed they need to 
			learn how to embrace themselves and learn to accept that each individual has unique traits
			that make them stand out to others.

			<b>Self- Concept</b> can be <b>adjusted</b> and <b>workout</b> for some exercise that the experts trying to do 
			People tend to behave in any circumstances and when someone asked them to recall the times 
			on what they do in the last few experiences and when is the last time they worked hard, individuals
			are generally to do a lot of things that they must have done but, they decided not to do it so.
			Meaning to say people tend to do things that they failed to do before if someone's reaching out 
			for them and in psychology, called it “ the act in accordance” it’s dit depends on the situation
			but the thing in this concept is when people brought that those thoughts someone minds’ when the
			person acknowledges that this something is really important, they must act and do it accordingly. 
			In this way, self-concept can be altered and adjusted
