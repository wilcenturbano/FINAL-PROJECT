		</p>
		<blockquote><p class="paragraph">
		Why do some people appear to have their lives in order, to know who they are, and to know 
		where they are going, while so many others appear to be lost and alone in this world? Perhaps 
		you are one of those people who is feeling lost. Maybe you're wondering if there's any meaning 
		or purpose in life, or you're just not sure what you're doing with your life. It's easy to believe 
		that others have it all figured out because of their gleaming exterior, until you walk a mile in 
		their shoes. Almost everyone has felt lost at some point in their lives. It's unavoidable. It doesn't 
		matter if you're rich or poor; life can be dull and pointless at times. This is due to the fact that 
		no one is born with an instruction manual for life. We're all attempting to make sense of our lives as 
		they unfold.
		</p></blockquote>
		<blockquote><p class="paragraph">
		And just because everyone feels lost at times does not mean it is always a pleasant experience. The 
		unfortunate reality is that there is no quick and easy way to figure out your life and overcome the 
		sense of being lost. However, as with many other aspects of life, a little extra understanding and 
		compassion can help you navigate through these negative feelings as if unaffected.
		</p></blockquote>
		<blockquote><p class="paragraph">
		Here are some major reasons why people feel lost in life.
		</p></blockquote>
		
		<h3>They have a skewed perception of themselves</h3>
		<blockquote><p class="paragraph">		
		People who are dissatisfied with their lives don't like themselves very much. They have a distorted 
		sense of self, which makes it difficult for them to appreciate their own beauty, intelligence, and 
		worth. They frequently refuse to accept one simple truth: who they are is sufficient. All they seem 
		to see is how inadequate, unworthy, or insignificant they are, and how nothing they do is sufficient.
		You will be depressed, sad, and unhappy if you see yourself as inferior and feel unworthy. You'll be 
		perplexed. That is why you must examine yourself objectively. You are unique – a treasured member of 
		the human family. You are not less valuable because you are different or unique in some way. Your 
		capacity for love, happiness, and success is the same as anyone else's.
		</p></blockquote>
		<blockquote><p class="paragraph">		
		Spend more time with yourself to discover who you truly are on the inside and what makes you happy. 
		Then go after the things that truly excite you. You owe it to yourself to live a happy life. Believe 
		in yourself and your own potential because no one else will if you don't. Any feelings of insignificance, 
		disconnection, or loneliness are simply illusions because you are nothing but significant, connected, and 
		loved, and you couldn't possibly be alone if you tried. Be content with who you are. All of your flaws, 
		quirks, and flaws are what make you unique and lovable.
		</p></blockquote>
		
		<br>
		
		<h3>They strive to live up to other people's expectations</h3>
		<blockquote><p class="paragraph">		
		People who are dissatisfied with their lives base their decisions on what other people believe to be true for 
		them. They live their lives in accordance with what others believe is best for them. As a result, they build 
		their lives around the ideals, thoughts, and beliefs instilled in them by their parents, teachers, friends, 
		and even the ever-opportunistic media. It's depressing when they try to live up to fantasies and other hyped 
		standards like beauty, power, and masculinity and fall far short. They are perplexed and wonder, "If that's 
		what'success' looks like, then who am I?". It's pointless to try to live up to the expectations of others. 
		You'll never make it. You will strive and strive, but you will still fall short. Why subject yourself to 
		unnecessarily high levels of conformity? You don't have to conform in order to succeed in life. You can live 
		authentically and be truly happy and content in life. You are your own unique individual. Live up to your own 
		standards. Only you know yourself better, which means only you can set realistic expectations for yourself.
		</p></blockquote>
		<blockquote><p class="paragraph">		
		Just stop comparing yourself to others. Look to others for inspiration, not self-fulfillment, and avoid anyone 
		who tries to impose their values on you. You're an adult now. Decide what is important to you and stop worrying 
		about not living up to other people's expectations. Let go of the perfection myths. Allow yourself to live your 
		life as you see fit. After all, it is your life, isn't it?
		</p></blockquote>
		
		<br>
		
		<h3>They cling to ingrained fears and biases from previous programming</h3>
		<blockquote><p class="paragraph">		
		People who feel lost and disconnected in life cling to ingrained fears and negative biases based on old programming 
		(often unconsciously). They think, and this holds them back: "The world is doomed," "It's not safe," "Nothing works 
		for me," "I always fail," and "My future or the future of my family is not guaranteed." Of course, nothing is 
		guaranteed! Nobody's future is certain. And we all fail. Nobody gets it right every time. If you've never failed, 
		it means you've never tried. These and many other self-defeating statements are based on fear, not reality. You must 
		change your perspective and attitude. Recognize that failure is simply the discovery of one method that does not work. 
		It's an opportunity to try again more carefully. As a result, don't be afraid to fail. It makes no difference what 
		happened to you as a child or how many times you "failed" in the past; get up and try again. The past does not have to 
		be a hindrance to your future.
		</p></blockquote>
		<blockquote><p class="paragraph">		
		Thomas A. Edison tried and "failed" over 10,000 times before finally succeeding and inventing the light bulb. Begin by 
		doing your best and letting bygones be bygones. Live in the present moment, learn from the past, and chart a course for 
		the life you want – the life you deserve. It will not be easy to create the life you desire, but it will be worthwhile 
		in the end.
		</p></blockquote>
		
		<br>
		
		<h3>They stay in their comfort zones</h3>
		<blockquote><p class="paragraph">		
		People who are dissatisfied with their lives tend to live within their comfort zones. Millions of people around the world, 
		for example, who suffer from sickening boredom at work may be doing it to themselves. They are bored, frustrated, and feel 
		trapped in their jobs because their choices have made them that way. They're stuck in ruts they've dug for themselves, 
		avoiding risks and making mistakes. Some habits, like the tiny, soft-bodied creatures that build coral reefs, begin small 
		and flexible and grow into massive barriers of rock all around your life. The water inside the reefs is warm, quiet, and 
		welcoming. Outside, you expect it to be rough and violent. There could be sharks. However, if you want to progress and develop 
		beyond where you are now, you must venture outside the reef of habits that define your comfort zone. There is no other option.
		</p></blockquote>
		<blockquote><p class="paragraph">		
		Get out there and do things that your friends would never guess you'd do. Push yourself to learn new, difficult skills and visit 
		new palaces. Living outside of your comfort zone is exhilarating and a lot of fun. It restores life's taste, zest, and satisfaction.
		<q>As Sadhguru once said, "the most beautiful moments in life are when you are expressing your joy, not when you are seeking [or even protecting] it.</q>
		</p></blockquote>
