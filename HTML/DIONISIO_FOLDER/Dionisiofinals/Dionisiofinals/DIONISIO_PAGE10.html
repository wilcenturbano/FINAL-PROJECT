<blockquote>It's clear that Michael Jackson was an incredibly talented person who touched so many people. As Jews, we are taught that everything that happens in life is there to teach us something. What can we learn from the life and death of Michael Jackson?

As the reports surrounding the details of his life and death materialized, a picture of a desperate and broken man began to emerge. Although the story-line was so familiar, it nonetheless defied logic. Why do we so often see those who have it all, lose it all? Michael Jackson indeed “had it all” -- talent, fame, fortune, the love and admiration of most of humanity. What went wrong?

I remember from my counseling courses in college that one of the main characteristics of people suffering with addictions is a lack of self-love. In a healthy person, self-love comes from within; it nurtures a person from the inside, and allows him to experience confidence, happiness and a sense of meaning in life. Unfortunately, many people lack the healthy self-love that comes from the inside, and desperately seek out that love through external experiences and pleasures.

What are the mechanics of self-love? How do we nurture it, and how do we betray it? When our actions are congruent with our core moral beliefs, we foster an inner love and respect for ourselves. When we have a vision of what is true and good, and then see ourselves behaving in a way that is aligned with that vision, we respect, appreciate, and value who we are. However, when we behave in ways that contradict our deepest values, we experience shame. That shame chips away at our feelings of self-respect, and self-love. When we go against our inner moral compass, our integrity suffers, and we begin to deplore ourselves.

It is a simple truth that living a value-centered life makes one beloved not only to others, but also to oneself.<blockquote><br><br><p class="para1">
