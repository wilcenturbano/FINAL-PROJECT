				<blockquote><p class="para1">Prominent people are those people that played a significant role in society. Some of them are well-known heads of state,
				while others contributed towards science, culture, economics, etc.

				Every April, TIME publishes a list of the 100 most influential people in the world, drawing on a year’s worth of headlines and the editorial judgment of editors from across the magazine. 
				It’s an unapologetically subjective undertaking; there are no batting averages or on-base percentages when it comes to a slippery subject like influence.

				I don’t have much to do with this list, but from the sidelines I got to wondering whether there was a quantitative way to produce something similar.
				 Wikipedia was a logical place to start since it has both unprecedented breadth–there are over 600,000 living people on the site–and a remarkably consistent structure for each entry.

				Based upon my research, here are the 100 most obsessed-over people on the web.There are many sites on the Internet where one can find
				 information on well-known international personalities and various prominent people but most of them contain limited information.
				 Biographies of interesting personalities are often difficult to find as many sites just casually refer to a prominent person. Often there are dozens of 
				 news clippings highlighting peripheral information or updates about his/her recent activities.

				In former President Mandela’s case one would rather like to read his life-story, and interesting details of his prison experiences rather than 
				browsing through old speeches, newspaper stories and the like.

				This web site offers a way to get factual information on specific prominent people in whom you may be interested. You are welcome to submit
				 interesting facts, figures or even photographs to make this site a real experience in knowledge about interesting people.

				Under prominent people one can classify leaders in different disciplines, heroes of wars, famous discoverers, high-placed officials,
				 the infamous members of society, legendary figures and those that are often referred to as “celebs”. Prominent people are those people 
				 that played a significant role in society. Some of them are well-known heads of state, while others contributed
				 towards science, culture, economics, etc.
