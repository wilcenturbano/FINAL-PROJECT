		<h3>Bob Ross</h3>
		<p class="paragraph"><blockquote>
		Bob Ross, whose iconic PBS television show The Joy of Painting (1983–94) made him 
		a household name as the painting instructor to the masses, was born on October 29, 1942, 
		in Daytona Beach, Florida, United States, and died on July 4, 1995, in New Smyrna Beach, Florida.
		</p></blockquote>
		<p class="paragraph"><blockquote>
		Ross was born and raised in the city of Orlando, Florida. Ross enlisted in the United States Air Force 
		at the age of 18 after finishing one year of high school and working as a carpenter with his father. 
		In the early 1960s, while stationed in Alaska, he took his first painting class at a United Service 
		Organizations club. However, it was television painting teacher Bill Alexander, whose show The Magic 
		of Oil Painting aired on PBS from 1974 to 1982, who taught him the wet-on-wet (alla prima) oil painting 
		technique that would make his career. Rather than waiting for the paint to dry between layers, the wet-on-wet 
		method involved spreading oil paint on top of still-wet oil paint. This allowed for a rapid completion 
		of the composition, making the technique especially suited to the half-hour television program structure. 
		Ross was a prolific painter who sold paintings of the Alaskan landscape to visitors while serving in the military.
		He left the military in 1981 and began taking private painting lessons with Alexander, eventually replacing 
		(and proving to be much more influential than) his PBS teacher. The Joy of Painting was first broadcast 
		in 1983 and lasted 11 years.
		</p></blockquote>
		<p class="paragraph"><blockquote>
		Ross projected a lovable hippie persona, complete with a permed afro and denim shirts and jeans, 
		as well as a calming and intimate speaking voice that made the audience feel as though they were 
		being taught how to paint one-on-one. He also astounded audiences with his effortless painting 
		technique, producing intricate landscapes in 30 minutes with a house painting brush and a palette 
		knife while talking and offering words of encouragement. His folksy approach and references to 
		"happy little" trees and clouds endeared him to his fans even more over time. Ross went on to 
		market his painting technique and found a hugely successful company (Bob Ross Inc.) that sold 
		instructional books, films, and a line of art supplies, as well as providing painting workshops 
		with teachers who were trained in his system, all of which remained lucrative well into the 
		twenty-first century. At the age of 52, he died of lymphoma.
		</p></blockquote>
		<p class="paragraph"><blockquote>
		The availability of The Joy of Painting on streaming sites like YouTube reignited interest 
		in Ross in the twenty-first century. Two of Ross's drawings, as well as his easel, palette, 
		and brushes, as well as other items related to The Joy of Art, were purchased by the Smithsonian 
		in 2020 for the American History Museum in Washington, D.C. The Bob Ross Experience opened in 
		Muncie, Indiana, the same year, where his show had been filmed. His studio was included in the museum, 
		which also provided a variety of workshops.
		</p></blockquote>

		<h3>Bob Ross Teaches us a lot about Positive Outlook and Self-Acceptance</h3>
		<p class="paragraph"><blockquote>		
		Joy, kindness, and compassion for oneself are all bundled together in self-acceptance, 
		self-worth, and self-esteem. It's a lot easier to consider someone else's differences 
		than it is to accept your own. But that was the point of an afternoon spent painting 
		with Bob Ross. We learn to praise our strengths while still appreciating our shortcomings 
		as we embrace ourselves; we learn to silence our inner critic and instead rely on our support 
		system—and recognize that we are worthy of their help.
		</p></blockquote>
		<p class="paragraph"><blockquote>
		One of the reasons why watching Bob Ross is so soothing is because his whole attitude is so optimistic. 
		He demonstrates that you have the power to shape your own life and make it a happier place. 
		It can be filled with happy little trees, happy little clouds, and happy little animals. 
		Your mentality has the power to influence your surroundings.
		</p></blockquote>

		</p>
		<p class="paragraph"><blockquote>
		Make a mental picture of what you want and go for it. Take a proactive approach to changing 
		the aspects you can, such as your own mindset. Have faith in the future. Rather than reflecting 
		on the past, remember that things will change in the future. Bob Ross tells us that everybody 
		has bad days, but they don't have to last forever. Don't let worry or a pessimistic attitude 
		get the best of you. What you believe is up to you, and having a positive attitude will help 
		you succeed.
		</p></blockquote>

		<h3>Bob Ross teaches us flexibility</h3>
		<p class="paragraph"><blockquote>	
		Another important aspect of resilience is flexibility, or the ability to solve problems. 
		There are several approaches to completing a task. When you face a challenge, instead of 
		giving up or falling into a spiral of self-pity, teach yourself to look for a different approach.
		And when things don't go as expected, Bob Ross teaches us how to make the most of a bad situation 
		and even learn from it. Viewers adore his idea of "happy little accidents," since it acknowledges 
		that we do have times where things go wrong, so we don't have to look at them negatively.
		</p></blockquote>
		<p style="text-align:center;">
		<img class="picture3" src="../../IMAGES/bob ross quote3.png" title="Bob Ross">
		</p>
		<p class="paragraph"><blockquote>	
		There is no eraser on a paintbrush. If something doesn't look the way he wants it to, 
		he doesn't get enraged and throw his canvas in the garbage (I might be tempted). 
		He is able to keep going forward and transform these errors into something constructive 
		because he is innovative and forward-thinking. He also doesn't exaggerate or exaggerate 
		stuff. After all, it's just a drawing, and it's supposed to be enjoyable. When those 
		"happy little accidents" occur, the painting can turn out differently than he expected, 
		but he doesn't let it bother him. Furthermore, audiences are unlikely to find a flaw in 
		the final product. While a personal disaster, for example, does not seem to be a 
		"happy little accident," the idea shows you that you will recover when things don't go as planned.
		Even in the toughest of circumstances, you can usually achieve something, even if it's 
		just knowing your own power in moving forward.
